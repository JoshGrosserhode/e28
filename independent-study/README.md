# Getting started and using BootstrapVue

## First What is Bootstrap
Basic introduction to bootstrap 4 and a simple example


## How is Bootstrap4 different than BootstrapVue and Why Should I Use It?
There are two distinct parts of Bootstrap, the CSS and the logic. Many of the Bootstrap components only use CSS and some use both CSS and jQuery, providing added functionality.
BootstrapVue on the otherhand does not use any jQuery and is instead written in Vue! This was done so that the BootstrapVue components will continue to be dynamic and controlled by the Vue framework.
Bootstrap 4 uses jQuery 


## Getting Started with BootstrapVue without Build
To incorporate BootstrapVue into your project without using a build system, simply include the following in the ` <head></head> ` section of your html page


`<head>
    <!-- Required Stylesheets -->
    <link
      type="text/css"
      rel="stylesheet"

    <link
      type="text/css"
